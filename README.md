# Mode Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Image Synthesis

Pytorch implementation for our mode seeking generative adversarial networks. We propose a simple yet effective mode seeking regularization term that can be applied to **arbitrary** conditional generative adversarial networks in different tasks to alleviate the mode collapse issue and improve the **diversity**.
